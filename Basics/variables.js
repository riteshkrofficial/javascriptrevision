const hey = 25644
let accessEmail='riteshg500@gmail.com'
var accessPassword = 435655
accountCity='pinkcity'  //not a good practice although this line can also run in js 
// console.log(accessEmail)
let useState;
console.table([hey,accessEmail,accessPassword,accountCity,useState])


//use of let and const is good 
//use of var create much errors in the file as var can be re-declared with same variable without showing any error
